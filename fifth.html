            <h4><strong>Introduction to Computing Project</strong> </h4>
            <p>Built a game called Tic Tac Toe which consists of noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os and it is made for two players. X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.</p>
            <p>The concept building creating this game was to relieve one’s mind due to stress. And it helps in critical thinking such as thinking of your opponent’s next move. </p>

            <h4><strong>Python Project</strong></h4>
            <p>Built a quiz game on general knowledge questions where the user has to choose the right answer between 4 possible options. This game builds and enlarges an individual’s thinking capabilities on general knowledge.</p>

            <h4><strong>Database Project</strong></h4>
            <p>Designed a database project that keeps track of Ashesi students’ projects (whether completed or not). The concept behind this was to make searching for a student’s project easy and avoid a lot of paperwork where the register has to go through lots of papers before finding a particular students projects list.</p>

    <div class="fourthProject">
        <h4><strong>Data Structures Project</strong></h4>
        <p>A project about the process of hashing. This project required the use of the python programing language to implement a hashing algorithm and also investigate the efficiency of the algorithms. Two methods were used to resolve collision on the hash tables, namely the Direct Chaining method and the Tree Overflow method. Both methods were compared to find their runtimes and as such determine which is more efficient in handling this problem. </p>
