            <p class="interest">
                My hobbies are going to arts exhibitions, taking photos, spending time with my family and friends and babysitting his nephews and nieces. I also enjoy meeting new people which is why I have been a volunteer in the Ashesi Leo Club for the past one year.

                During my leisure time, it is either I play tennis, read a book or jump into a modelling session. An interesting factor about me is, I do not take my summer vacations as a joke!
